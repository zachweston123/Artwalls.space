## Handoff Notes for Engineering

### Stripe Payment Implementation

**Three-Way Split Options:**

**Option 1: Stripe Connect (Recommended for Production)**
```tsx
// Requires:
- Artist has Stripe Connect account
- Venue has Stripe Connect account
- Platform uses Stripe Connect to split payments

// Benefits:
- Automated splits on every transaction
- Artists/venues get paid directly
- Platform handles compliance

// Implementation:
- Use Stripe Connect onboarding for artists/venues
- Create Checkout Session with transfers
- Splits happen automatically
```

**Option 2: Payment Links (MVP Alternative)**
```tsx
// Simpler approach:
- Collect full payment to platform
- Calculate splits in database
- Schedule manual payouts via Stripe Transfers API

// Limitations:
- Manual payout scheduling
- Platform holds funds temporarily
- More operational overhead

// Good for:
- MVP/beta
- Low transaction volume
```

### Apple Pay Conditional Display

```tsx
// Don't promise Apple Pay will always appear
// Show hint only when supported:

const [applePayAvailable, setApplePayAvailable] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  if (window.ApplePaySession && 
      ApplePaySession.canMakePayments()) {
    setApplePayAvailable(true)
  }
}, [])

// In UI:
{applePayAvailable && (
  <span className="text-sm text-success">
    🍎 Apple Pay available
  </span>
)}
```

**Stripe handles actual presentation** - you just enable it in Checkout Session config.

### QR Code Best Practices

**Server-Side Generation (Recommended)**
```tsx
// Reasons:
- Consistent quality
- Can cache/store QR images
- Security (no client-side short code exposure)

// Library: qrcode (Node.js)
npm install qrcode

import QRCode from 'qrcode'

const url = `https://art.wls/${shortCode}`
const qrDataURL = await QRCode.toDataURL(url, {
  errorCorrectionLevel: 'H', // 30% damage tolerance
  margin: 4, // Quiet zone
  width: 450, // 1.5" @ 300 DPI
  color: { dark: '#000000', light: '#FFFFFF' }
})
```

### Short URL Redirect Logic

```tsx
// Backend route
app.get('/api/short/:code', async (req, res) => {
  const listing = await db.listings.findByShortCode(req.params.code)
  
  if (!listing) {
    return res.redirect('/listings/not-found')
  }
  
  if (listing.status === 'sold') {
    return res.redirect(`/listings/${listing.id}?sold=true`)
  }
  
  if (listing.status === 'expired') {
    return res.redirect('/listings/not-found')
  }
  
  if (listing.status === 'replaced') {
    return res.redirect('/listings/qr-replaced')
  }
  
  // Active listing
  return res.redirect(`/listings/${listing.id}`)
})
```

### Webhook Idempotency

```tsx
// Critical: Store Stripe event IDs to prevent duplicate processing

app.post('/webhooks/stripe', async (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body
  
  // Check if already processed
  const exists = await db.stripeEvents.findOne({ 
    eventId: event.id 
  })
  
  if (exists) {
    return res.json({ received: true }) // Already processed
  }
  
  // Process event
  if (event.type === 'checkout.session.completed') {
    await processPayment(event.data.object)
  }
  
  // Store event ID
  await db.stripeEvents.create({ eventId: event.id })
  
  res.json({ received: true })
})
```
