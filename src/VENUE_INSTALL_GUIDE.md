## 🔗 Step 4: Place & Test the QR Code

### Getting Your QR Code

- **Print on:** Cardstock or waterproof label stock (glossy recommended)
- **Size:** 4×6 inches is standard (prints well at 300 DPI)

### Placement Tips

**Position the QR Code:**
- ✅ **Eye level** (4-5 feet from ground, matching artwork height)
- ✅ **Within 2 feet of the artwork** (so customers know it's associated)
- ✅ **Well-lit area** (avoid shadows, backlighting issues)
- ✅ **Accessible** (customers can easily aim their phone camera)
- ✅ **Protected** (won't be rubbed against or damaged)

**Bad Placements to Avoid:**
- ❌ Too low (below waist height - customers miss it)
- ❌ Too high (above eye level, hard to read)
- ❌ In shadow or dark corner
- ❌ Covered by furniture or plants
- ❌ More than 3 feet away from artwork
- ❌ Placed upside down or sideways

### Mounting Your QR Label

**Option 1: Printed Label (Recommended)**

2. Use corner mounting tape or adhesive backing
3. Position near artwork (preferably at 45° angle toward customer view)
4. Press firmly to ensure it sticks
5. Test that it's secure

**Option 2: Plastic Sleeve**
1. Insert printed QR in clear plastic sleeve
2. Mount sleeve near artwork with mounting tape
3. Protects from damage and dirt
4. Easy to replace if damaged

**Option 3: Frame-Mounted**
1. Laminate QR code for durability
2. Mount on small stand or frame near artwork
3. Can include "Scan to Purchase" text
4. More professional appearance

### Testing the QR Code (CRITICAL)

**Test immediately after placement:**

1. **Step Back** (6-10 feet away - customer perspective)

3. **Point at QR code** - your phone should recognize it automatically
   - You should see a notification to tap
