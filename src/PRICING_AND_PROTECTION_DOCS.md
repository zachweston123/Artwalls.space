## Active Displays and Overage Pricing

### What Are "Active Displays"?
Active displays are artworks currently displayed at venues through Artwalls placements. Each plan includes a set number of active displays:
- **Free:** 1 active display
- **Starter:** 4 active displays  
- **Growth:** 10 active displays
- **Pro:** Unlimited active displays

### Overage Pricing
If you exceed your plan's included active displays, overage charges apply:
- **Free:** No overage option (limited to 1 display)
- **Starter:** $5/month per additional active display
- **Growth:** $4/month per additional active display  
- **Pro:** No overage charges (unlimited)

### Example Overage Calculations
**Starter plan with 6 active displays:**
- 4 displays included in $9/mo subscription
- 2 displays over the limit
- Overage charge: 2 × $5 = **$10/mo**
- **Total monthly cost: $19/mo** ($9 base + $10 overage)

**Growth plan with 12 active displays:**
- 10 displays included in $19/mo subscription  
- 2 displays over the limit
- Overage charge: 2 × $4 = **$8/mo**
- **Total monthly cost: $27/mo** ($19 base + $8 overage)

### Overage Management
- Artwalls may pause new placements if unpaid overages accrue
- Artists can manage displays to avoid overages
- Recommended: Upgrade to next tier if consistently over limit
- Active Displays Meter in dashboard shows real-time usage

---

## Payout Timing

### Payout Speed by Plan
- **Free:** Weekly payouts (every 7 days)
- **Starter:** Standard payouts (bi-weekly or monthly)
- **Growth:** Standard payouts (bi-weekly or monthly)
- **Pro:** Fast payouts (coming soon - daily or 48-hour)

### Benefits of Different Payout Speeds
- **Weekly (Free):** More frequent cash flow for occasional sellers
- **Standard (Starter/Growth):** Regular, predictable payout schedule
- **Fast (Pro):** Fastest access to earnings for high-volume artists

---

## Break-Even Calculator

### How It Works
The pricing page includes an interactive break-even calculator that helps artists determine which plan saves them the most money based on monthly sales volume.

### Break-Even Points
Approximate monthly sales where upgrading pays for itself:
- **Starter vs Free:** ≈ $180/mo in sales
- **Growth vs Free:** ≈ $272/mo in sales
- **Pro vs Free:** ≈ $433/mo in sales

### Calculator Features
- Slider or numeric input for monthly sales
- Real-time total cost calculation for each plan
- Recommended plan based on lowest total cost
- Disclaimer: "Estimates exclude payment processing fees"

### Example Calculations
**$300/mo in sales:**
- Free: $45 in fees (15%) = **$45 total cost**
- Starter: $30 in fees (10%) + $9 = **$39 total cost** ← Recommended
- Growth: $24 in fees (8%) + $19 = **$43 total cost**
- Pro: $18 in fees (6%) + $39 = **$57 total cost**

**$600/mo in sales:**
- Free: $90 in fees (15%) = **$90 total cost**
- Starter: $60 in fees (10%) + $9 = **$69 total cost**
- Growth: $48 in fees (8%) + $19 = **$67 total cost** ← Recommended
- Pro: $36 in fees (6%) + $39 = **$75 total cost**

**$1,000/mo in sales:**
- Free: $150 in fees (15%) = **$150 total cost**
- Starter: $100 in fees (10%) + $9 = **$109 total cost**
- Growth: $80 in fees (8%) + $19 = **$99 total cost**
- Pro: $60 in fees (6%) + $39 = **$99 total cost** ← Growth/Pro tied

---

## Revenue Split

### Base Split
- **Artist:** 80% of sale price
- **Venue:** 10% of sale price
- **Artwalls:** 10% of sale price

### Platform Fees (Applied to Artist Portion)
- **Free/Starter:** 10% platform fee
- **Growth:** 8% platform fee
- **Pro:** 6% platform fee

### Example Calculation
For a $1,000 artwork sale:
- **Free/Starter Plan:**
  - Artist: $800 - $100 (10% fee) = **$700**
  - Venue: $100
  - Artwalls: $100 + $100 (fee) = $200
- **Growth Plan:**
  - Artist: $800 - $64 (8% fee) = **$736**
  - Venue: $100
  - Artwalls: $100 + $64 (fee) = $164
- **Pro Plan:**
  - Artist: $800 - $48 (6% fee) = **$752**
  - Venue: $100
  - Artwalls: $100 + $48 (fee) = $148
