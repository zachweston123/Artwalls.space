## 🛡️ Why It's Fraud-Proof

**Email domain verification:**
- Stanford University owns @stanford.edu
- Only Stanford IT can create @stanford.edu emails
- Attacker can't create fake @stanford.edu address
- Email servers verify domain (technical impossibility)

**Result:** Fraud is basically impossible without hacking Stanford
