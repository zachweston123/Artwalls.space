## 💡 Key Concepts

### How It Works
```
Student signs up with .edu email
         ↓
System detects and shows "Get 25% Off" prompt
         ↓
Student verifies: selects school + enters .edu email
         ↓
Email domain verification check
         ↓
IF domain matches school: Instantly verified ✓
IF no match: Pending admin review
         ↓
Discount activated in database
         ↓
Badge shows on profile: "✓ Verified Student • 25% Off"
         ↓
Student saves $237-1,797/year for next 12 months
```

### Why It's Secure
- Email domain owned by institution (Stanford, MIT, etc.)
- Only institutional email can access domain
- Email servers verify domain ownership
- Fraud would require hacking university servers
- Backup: Manual admin review for non-domain schools

### Why It's Profitable
- Students get attractive discount ($237-1,797/year)
- You get cheaper student customer acquisition
- Students upgrade more often
- Word-of-mouth growth from student community
- ROI positive in 3-4 months
