# SPA routing for Cloudflare Pages
# Cloudflare Pages serves index.html for 404s automatically when using a
# single-page app. A catch-all /* rule causes an infinite-loop warning,
# so we omit it and rely on Pages' built-in SPA behavior instead.
# See: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/serving-pages/
